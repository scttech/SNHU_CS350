# Module 2

Explores using Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) with an LED on the Raspberry Pi

# Going beyond

Blinking an LED is fun, but PWM can be used for many other applications. 

In addition, PWM helps us explore concepts such as:

* Critical Flicker Fusion (CFF) - the frequency at which flickering light can be perceived as continuous.
* Duty Cycle - the proportion of time a signal is active versus inactive in one cycle. The PWM duty cycle provides linear power output, however humans have a logarithmic response. This means that we need to optimize for human perception.
