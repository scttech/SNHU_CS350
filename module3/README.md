Explore the Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter (UART) 

## Overview

The `led_client.py` script can pass commands to the `led_server.py` script using UART communication. 

By passing the `blink` command the LED on the server side will blink on and off.

By passing the `quit` command both the server and client will exit.
